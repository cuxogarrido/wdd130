        Most people in Latin America have received minimal knowledge about finances, and some of them haven’t received any education at all,   as poverty and unemployability  have been increasing over the year,  there are several institution most of them run by the state of those countries, that spends resources trying to find a solution, some of them help providing job offerings or connections to possible jobs. Even though that helps, people recurring those places tend to lose their jobs or feel unprepared. I have always believed that the problem relies in the minimal preparation people have to occupy those jobs, and that people need to learn skills to keep them.

        Unemployed people have a strong desire to start their own business, mostly offering services they feel comfortable working with because they have experience in those areas, but they don`t know what to do next. That reminded me when I interviewed the Marketing Manager of “Elquí Web”, a friend of mine, and he told me referring about new businesses that try to compete with them.

He said: If you have an idea, but you have no way of implementation you have        nothing.

A big part of unemployed people have no way to implement their ideas, just to enumerate a few reasons.
